`Time Series` In a bid to drive revenue, you’ll produce a `Jupyter` notebook that contains your data preparation, analysis, and visualizations for all the time series data that the company needs to understand. You’ll use text and comments to document your findings, and you’ll answer the question prompts in the instructions. Specifically, this file should contain the following:
Visual depictions of seasonality (as measured by Google Search traffic) that are of interest to the company.
An evaluation of how the company’s stock price correlates to its Google Search traffic.
A `Prophet` **forecast** model that can predict hourly user search traffic.
